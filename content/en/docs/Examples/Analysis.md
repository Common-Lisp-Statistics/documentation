These notebooks describe how to undertake statistical analyses introduced as examples in the Ninth Edition of _Introduction to the Practices of Statistics_ (2017) by Moore, McCabe and Craig. The notebooks are organised in the same manner as the chapters of the book. The data comes from the site [IPS9 in R](https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/) by Nicholas Horton.
